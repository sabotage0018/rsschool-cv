####About me
 Recently I wanted to learn how to program. I was choosing between python and js. I started learning python in a free interactive basic course, but about halfway through the course, watching videos about these languages, I decided to switch to js. I was attracted to the fact that this language can solve absolutely different problems and is popular. I asked friends where I could find a good course and they recommended rs-school. I really hope I can make it to the end of the course because I have very little knowledge at the moment. I plan to get an interview during or after this course and at best already work as a developer. Good luck to me
